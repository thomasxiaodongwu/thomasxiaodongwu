# üöÄ thomasxiaodongwu | Blockchain Protocol & Strategy Engineer

Welcome!  
I am a Blockchain Developer with a proven record of extracting alpha, building infra, and shipping product across **DeFi, NFT, and MEV** verticals. My strength is a **deep, engineering-level grasp of major DeFi protocols**, paired with elite coding skills across Rust, Python, Solidity, NodeJS, Golang, and more.

## üí° Why I Stand Out

- **Protocol Depth:** Comprehensive, hands-on exploration and implementation with a vast array of DeFi and NFT protocols: Uniswap, Curve, AAVE, Pendle, MakerDAO, Magic Eden, Pump.fun, GMX, Yearn, and others.
- **Alpha-Driven Strategies:** Designed, simulated, and deployed advanced on-chain/off-chain strategies‚Äîarbitrage, liquidation, market making, cross-chain, funding rate, oracle delay, and more.
- **Systemic Approach:** Architected robust backend systems for real-time blockchain data, high-frequency trading, and DAO infrastructure.
- **Multi-Domain Impact:** Experience across DeFi trading, NFT infra, protocol analytics, indexers, wallets, and security auditing.

## üåê Protocol Mastery & Project Highlights

### üî• DeFi Arbitrage, Liquidation, Yield Optimization

- **Curve Finance Arbitrage & Yield**
    - Multi-layer arbitrage: oracle delay, fee, parameter, and cross-pool strategies.
    - Automated monitoring/alerting (Discord, Telegram), gas-optimized execution, and simulation engines.
    - SCRVUSD yield optimizer: vault/handler monitoring, APY maximization.
    - Cross-chain arbitrage: inflation, weight, price, bridge cost/safety strategies.

- **AAVE V3 Liquidation Bot**
    - Health factor/price monitoring, flash-loan liquidation, E-Mode price source arbitrage.

- **Pendle Arbitrage System**
    - Multi-strategy (exchange rate, oracle, implied rate, split/merge) with real-time market and risk management.

- **MakerDAO Arbitrage Engine**
    - Auction, rate, oracle, and parameter-based automated arbitrage.

- **Ethena Strategy Framework**
    - Delta-neutral, funding rate, price deviation, and supply-based signal generation for automated trading.

### üèôÔ∏è NFT Protocols & Market Infrastructure

- **Magic Eden (Solana) Core Contracts**
    - M2: NFT marketplace with programmable NFTs, royalties, OCP, multi-currency support, and notary mechanisms.
    - M3: Compressed NFT protocol‚Äîforced royalties, atomic swaps, maker-taker fees, double-spend prevention.
    - MMM-AMM: NFT AMM for collection bids, dynamic liquidity, batch trading, and royalty integration.

- **Solana NFT Indexer & Event Systems**
    - Complete NFT/account/trade indexer: validator integration, Kafka pipelines, PostgreSQL/Mongo analytics, and high-throughput API services.

### ‚ö° MEV, Arbitrage & On-Chain Execution

- **Solana Jito-Lab Sandwich Attack Bot**
    - Custom Jito validator/relayer for reconstructed mempool, pump.fun tx analysis, and sandwich execution.
    - High-speed Geyser plugins, TPU packet relays, Redis-based parsing, and AWS infra for sub-second profitability.

- **GMX Solana Strategy System**
    - Multi-strategy (market-making, trend, funding, latency) trading framework in Rust.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Token Launch & Fundraising Protocols

- **MagicFun Sol (Solana) & MagicFun (EVM)**
    - Bonding curve-based token creation, AMM mechanics, auto-Uniswap listing, and locked liquidity.

---

### üîí Security & Auditing

- **Smart Contract Audits**
    - Slither, Mythril for Solidity code; eliminated reentrancy, overflow, storage, and selfdestruct risks.

---

### üíπ Quantitative & Backend Engineering

- **High-Frequency Quant Trading Engine**
    - Go-based, channel-sharded HFT core, websocket feeds, skiplist orderbook, tick prediction.

- **Web3 Wallet & Backend Systems**
    - Full-stack Ethereum wallet with Dockerized node infra, secure deposit/withdraw, MySQL/Redis backend.
